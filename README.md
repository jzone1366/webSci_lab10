SPARQL/RDF, FOAF
----------------

In this lab, 5 SPARQL queries were performed against the dbpedia endpoint. Writing the queries to get specific information. The Questions and answers are in the doc.
There are many similarities between SPARQL and SQL. SPARQL makes if very simple to pull information and display it in a useful manner. Once you know the resources and the ontologies that are being used in on the endpoint then writing queries to dive deeper into the data is relatively simple. By using Dbpedia you can easily pull a list of cities in Texas as well as pull the total size of their area and list it in either ascending or descending order. Also you can Drill down deeper into the cities by clicking on them to get information about the city. This helps to make more queries and ensure you get the information that you want. 

Also, a Friend of a Friend RDF file was created. This file can be included on a web page so that the infromation is more easily available to computers to read. Creating a FOAF file isn't that difficult because it is a basic RDF file following the FOAF standard. There are also online generators that will create a FOAF rdf file from the information that you enter into the form on the page.
